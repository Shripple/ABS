# ABS
Chrome Extension and Firefox Addon to automatically perform a number of daily searches and collect bonus reward points.

Chrome & Firefox extensions removed, only available via Git now. This version is specifically to counter the accounts that end up at the URL with /?redref=amc at the end. As far as I can tell this will also work for accounts that don't have this problem as it's still a valid rewards URL so this should be universal.
